Just like an etch-a-sketch, but with added fucntionality, such as:

    Pen size
    Color selection
    Pen type (including marker pen, water colors and 'flashy' pen)

Delete colors from the palette by double clicking on them.

!! Still not working perfectly in Firefox. For best results run in Chrome.

 !! Still not working perfectly in Firefox. For best results run in Chrome.

Just like an etch-a-sketch, but with added fucntionality, such as:

    Pen size
    Color selection
    Pen type (including marker pen, water colors and 'flashy' pen)

Delete colors from the palette by double clicking on them.

Practice Point: This was my first project using jQuery.
